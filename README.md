Genomecomparer.py is the main tool developed. It is highly reccomended to use anaconda and download BUSCO along with its dependencies to use. In the case BUSCO cannot 
be install, the code requires BLAST, NCBI Command Line, Biopython, Scipy, Statsmodels, and Numpy. These opensource packages are essential in order to run the code.
In addition, two folders, Storage and Trash should be created ion the same folder before running the code. This will help clean up the zip files that are downloaded,
and it will allow for detailed organization for results.

Excelparcer.py is a specific tool used in this project. It is used to organize the results of the data that I gathered. Unless the same superclasses are used, it should
be modified to be similar to what the user desires.
